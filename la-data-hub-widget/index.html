                            The Data Justice Hub is an initiative that empowers students, community organizations, and faculty to access and use data to rectify harm. We hope this digital tool will help train the next generation of social justice and data change agents. With an estimated population of approximately 10 million people, Los Angeles County is the most populous in the United States and, thus, consequential for our understanding of the world at large. This online data directory provides easy access to open-source datasets containing valuable information about the Los Angeles region. Assembled under different tabs are links to datasets, trainings, and analysis relevant to studying the greater Los Angeles region. Specifically, the datasets have been curated in relation to a range of social justice issues: policing, incarceration, economics, education, climate change, food insecurity, gender, racialization, houselessness, political disenfranchisement, migration, public health, and state violence.

                            This site has been developed through the Mellon Social Justice Curricular Initiatives at UCLA. The new "Data, Justice, and Society" curricular initiatives aim is to create a "data-driven approach to teaching and research on social justice issues, positioning more UCLA graduates to become social change leaders in their chosen professions."

                            Data-based computation (i.e. algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, predictive modeling) increasingly play a dominant role in shaping our everyday experiences of culture, work, and society. Data and data analytics impact everything from social relations and public policy to juridical status, governance, and market logistics. Yet, exactly how does the rise of technological corporate wealth compare with the standard of living of Los Angeles's "working poor"?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="placeholder-text">
                            Since data-based claims are embedded in complex power relations, the mission of this website is to encourage "data justice" methods and analysis that challenges the injustices confronting the diverse communities of the greater Los Angeles region. Data Justice is a technique and ethos emerging from the new field of Critical Data Studies (CDS) that asks questions such as the above. A "data justice" critical view recognizes the link between the increasing datafication of society and social inequality. On the one hand, a data justice approach places a critical lens on the way "Big Tech" deploys data-driven algorithms to cause harm. On the other hand, data justice researchers and practitioners mobilize analysis of open-source datasets as well as findings from other data sources to redress these harms. Data justice aspires to enact change precisely through more ethical and just application of data.

                            This site is meant as an instructional tool to empower members of the UCLA community and public with easier access to datasets relevant to research on selected social justice issues. To find such datasets, we recommend opening the "Data and Dashboards" tab and opening the link to the social justice issue of your choice. The list of sites that you will find contain repositories of vast amounts of data that you can analyze to better understand some of the largest issues facing the Los Angeles communities today.

                            Christian Nielsen Garcia's current research investigates the socio-technical dynamics of decentralized governance, with a particular focus on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). His work aims to develop innovative metrics that more accurately capture political decentralization. By utilizing Natural Language Processing, Network Analysis, and agent-based modeling, Garcia examines participation and representation dynamics to inform the creation of more equitable governance systems. He is a recipient of the Mellon GSE Grant, the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) Award, and the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence Award.

These efforts reflect Garcia's broader commitment to advancing sustainable, accountable, and participatory governance models, both online and offline.

                            This section brings together trusted sources of open data. Before exploring them, it is useful to understand what open data is and why it matters. Open data refers to information that anyone can access, use, and share with minimal restrictions. It lowers barriers so communities, researchers, and institutions can study problems, build tools, and develop insights that support justice and accountability.
                        </p>
                        <p class="placeholder-text">
                            Several frameworks guide how people and organizations release data to the public. They emphasize accessibility, transparency, interoperability, and equity so that open data can meaningfully serve its users.
                        </p>
                        <p class="placeholder-text">
                            As Christine Borgman explains, however, making data open does not automatically make it reusable. Her work highlights a number of practices that influence whether data can actually be understood and applied by others, including ideas such as Context is Crucial, Knowledge Exchange vs. Transaction, Infrastructure Involves People, Not Just Technology, Incentives Matter, Purpose Driven Strategies, Recognize the Distances, and Support for Reproducibility. These concepts point to the social, technical, and institutional conditions needed for genuine reuse.
                        </p>

                            For a deeper discussion of these practices and why they matter, see Christine L.

                            Please note that Los Angeles City data is distinct from Los Angeles County data, as well as state and national data. All of these distinct data hubs each contain valuable data about Los Angeles, although covering different geographic scopes. The best way to identify which data you need is to explore the individual links. In several of the sites below, you will also be able to locate data by inputting a specific Zip Code. This technique will enable you to find data about a particular neighborhood.

                            This section of the LA Data Justice Hub presents examples of data analysis research pipelines, illustrating different ways to approach datasets and extract insights. Data analysis is inherently exploratory—there is no single path, but rather multiple methods depending on the questions asked and the tools used. By showcasing concrete examples, from data collection to analysis, visualization, and communication, we aim to provide useful reference points for researchers, advocates, and policymakers. These walkthroughs highlight the diversity of approaches while offering practical guidance for structuring and conducting data-driven investigations.

                                        This article critically examines the dominant narratives surrounding the "digital divide," challenging reductive understandings of digital access disparities. Through an analysis of census data on internet and computer access in Los Angeles, the study illustrates how statistical interpretations often flatten the complexities of digital inequities, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. Using data visualization techniques, the research highlights the limitations of the binary framing of digital access and demonstrates how marginalized communities actively navigate and adapt to infrastructural barriers. By comparing broadband and computer access with mobile device and data usage, the article deconstructs the myth of totalizing disenfranchisement, showing that digital inequities are not merely a matter of access but are embedded within structural and racialized infrastructural inequalities. The findings emphasize the need for a more nuanced discourse that recognizes both systemic constraints and the agency of communities in shaping their digital experiences. This work contributes to the broader discussions on data justice, digital equity, and the socio-political implications of how access is framed in policy and public discourse.
